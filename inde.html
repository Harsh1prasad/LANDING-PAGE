                <p>A tabla is a pair of hand drums from the Indian subcontinent. Since the 18th century, it has been the
                    principal percussion instrument in Hindustani classical music, where it may be played solo, as an
                    accompaniment with other instruments and vocals, or as a part of larger ensembles. It is frequently
                    played in popular and folk music performances in India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal and
                    Sri Lanka. The tabla is an essential instrument in the bhakti devotional traditions of Hinduism and
                    Sikhism, such as during bhajan and kirtan singing. It is one of the main qawwali instruments used by
                    Sufi musicians. The instrument is also featured in dance performances such as Kathak. Tabla is a
                    rhythmic instrument.

                    The name tabla likely comes from tabl, the Arabic word for drum. The ultimate origin of the musical
                    instrument is contested by scholars, though some trace its evolution from indigenous musical
                    instruments of the Indian subcontinent.

                    The tabla consists of two small drums of slightly different sizes and shapes. Each drum is made of
                    hollowed-out wood, clay or metal. The smaller drum (dayan/tabla) is used for creating treble and
                    tonal sounds, while the primary function of the larger drum (baya/dagga) is for producing bass. They
                    are laced with hoops, thongs and wooden dowels on its sides. The dowels and hoops are used to
                    tighten the tension of the membranes for tuning the drums.

                    The playing technique is complex and involves extensive use of the fingers and palms in various
                    configurations to create a wide variety of different sounds and rhythms, reflected in mnemonic
                    syllables (bol)</p>.
